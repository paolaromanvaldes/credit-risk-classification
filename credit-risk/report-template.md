## Overview of the Analysis

In this credit-risk report challenge, I have built a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan is high risk or low risk at the moment. The purpose of this analysis would be to predict the reliability of the borrower before they default on payments. I used linear regression and made a learning model that can divide loans into two categories, low risk or high risk loans. 



## Results

The model seems to be relatively accurate although the data seems to be skewed towards low risk loans. The given data included 75,036 results for low risk loans and 2500 for high risk loans leading the model to be more skewed towards low risk loans. Out of all the loans, the recall for healthy loans was 1% and the recall for high risk loans was 9%.  

## Summary

While the model is not completely accurate, 85 percent is a usable metric for predictions on high risk loans. I would recommend the model for very unoffical use, more as a light assessment on whether the borrower will be high risk. I would not make any executive decisions on high risk loans due to the precision being under 98 percent.
